# pass-chrome

A chrome browser extension for [pass](http://www.passwordstore.org/)

This is very much a work in progress, expect a better README, installation
instructions and maybe even a Chrome Store entry soon.

## Requirements

* Pass is installed and initialized, available to system as `pass` command
* `pwgen` installed, a requirement of Pass so should be fine
* Python. This extension uses native messaging, a python script wraps the
communication
